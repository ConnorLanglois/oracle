## About The Project

Oracle™ is an application built to predict the movement of the stock market.

By leveraging state-of-the-art AI LSTM neural networks and vasts amount of data, Oracle™ learns which stock features signal a rise or fall in price.

Currently, it has about a 60% accuracy in predicting the daily movement of a stock.

### Built With

* [Python](https://www.python.org/) - The scripting language
* [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com) - The scientific package management and deployment library
* [Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org) - The machine learning library
* [Keras](https://keras.io) - The high-level wrapper library over Tensorflow
* [Numpy](https://numpy.org) - The fast numeric library
* [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org) - The data frame library
* [Scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org) - Another machine learning library
